```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

There were `r nrow(cars)` cars studied.

This summation expression $\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ appears inline.   
or expressed in a new line.
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2}
$$

Following default rule
```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

Hiding codes / Showing results
```{r, echo=F}
head(mtcars)
```

No executes / Showing only codes
```{r, eval=F}
head(mtcars)
```

```{r, fig.cap = "scatterplot: cars", fig.align = "center", fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
plot(cars, pch = 18)
```

```{r, echo=F, fig.cap = "tidyverse logo", fig.align = "center"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("https://www.tidyverse.org/images/tidyverse-default.png")
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
